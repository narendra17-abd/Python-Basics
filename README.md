# Definition:
In Python, strings are a sequence of characters enclosed within either single quotes (''), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''', """ """).

# Immutability:
Strings in Python are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings derived from existing ones.

# Escape Characters:
Strings support escape characters, prefixed by a backslash (), used to represent special characters like newline (\n), tab (\t), or backslash (\).

# Raw Strings:
Prefixed with an 'r' or 'R', raw strings treat backslashes as literal characters, commonly used in regular expressions or file paths.

# Indexing and Slicing:
Access individual characters or substrings using indexing and slicing. Negative indexing starts from the end of the string.

# String Methods:
Python provides numerous built-in methods for string manipulation, such as strip(), split(), join(), find(), replace(), startswith(), endswith(), isdigit(), isalpha(), islower(), isupper(), etc.



String Formatting: Strings support various formatting techniques like the format() method, f-strings, and the old-style formatting using the % operator.

String Constants: The string module provides constants for dealing with ASCII and printable characters, such as string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation, etc.
